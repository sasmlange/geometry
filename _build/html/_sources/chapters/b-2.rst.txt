Chapter 2: Logical Arguments and Line Relationships 
==========================================================

2.1: Conjectures and Counterexamples
-----------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **conterexample** statement where the hypothesis is the same but conclusion is different.
| **Inductive reasoning** is reasoning with examples
| A **conjecture** is a concluding statement based on inductive reasoning 

.. rubric:: Example of Conterexample

| Hypothesis: The lost planet is round.
| Conclusion: The planet is Neptune as Neptune is round.
| Conterexample: Mars is also round.

Since a conterexample was provided, the conclusion is false.

.. rubric:: Example of Conjectures

Think about this pattern: *0, 5, 10, 15, 20*

A conclusion or conjecture can be made that it incresses by 5.


2.2: Statements, Conditionals, and Biconditionals
------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **truth value** is whether or not a statement is true based on the given information.
| A **truth table** is a table where truth values are organized.

.. rubric:: Logical Operators

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Name
      - Symbol
    * - `^`
      - And
    * - `v`
      - Or
    * - `~`
      - Not 
    
.. rubric:: Truth Tables

| a: Mars is red
| b: Mars is blue


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - a
     - b
     - a v b
     - a ^ b
     - ~b
   * - true
     - false
     - true
     - false
     - false


2.3: conditional Statements
-----------------------------
.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **conditional statement** is written in a if then statement. 
| Switching the if and then makes it a **converse** of the statement. 
| An **inverse** of a statement is when you take the oposite of the if and the opposite of the then.
| A **contrapositive** is the inverse of the converse.

.. rubric:: Python Examples of Vocabulary

.. code-block:: python

  # fact
  a = True
  b = False

  # conditional statement
  if a:
    b = False

  # converse
  if not b:
    a = True

  # inverse
  if not a:
    b = not False # aka True
  
  # contrapositive
  if b:
    a = not True # aka False

All of these ifs produce the same result!!!

.. rubric:: Identifying the Hypothesis and Conclusion

The hypothesis is the statement that follows the if while the conclusion follows the then. 

**For example:**

.. code-block:: python

  if a:
    b = True

In this example :code:`a` or :code:`a == True` is the hypothesis and :code:`b = True` is the conclusion.



2.4: Deductive Reasoning
---------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| **Deductive reasoning** is when a logical conclusion is reached from using facts, rules, definitions, or properties.
| The **Law of Detachment** is a valid form of deductive reasoning with an if then format and a conclusion.
| The **Law of Syllogism** is a valid form of deductive reasoning which can be used to pice together two or more statements in which one has a conclusion of the other hypothesis.

.. rubric:: Examples

| **Given:** If you ride to school then you have a bike. Bob rides to school.
| **Conclusion:** Bob has a bike

This is a valid conclusion made using the Law of Detachment.

.. note::

  If the converse of the given hypothesis was given, then the conclusion would be invalid.  This is because the fact code :code:`Bob rides to school` would address the conclusion instead of the hypothesis.


2.5: Postulate and Paragraph Proof
---------------------------------------



.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| An **axiom** is a statement that is accepted without proof. 
| An **postual** is the same as an axiom. 
| A **paragraph proof** is a paragraph to explain why a conjecture is true. 

.. rubric:: Proofs

#. Though any two points, there is one line.
#. Though any three points, there is one plane.
#. A line contains at least two points
#. A plane contains as least three points
#. If two points of a line are in a plane, the line is on the line.

2.6: Algebraic Proof
-------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| The **property of equality** states that if the same operation is conducted on both sides of an equation on the same number, then both sides of an equations are equal.
| The **addition property of equality** states that if a number is added to both sides of an equation, then both sides of an equation are equal.
| The **subtraction property of equality** states that if a number is subtraction from both sides of an equation then both sides of an equation are equal.
| The **multiplication property of equality** states that if a number is multiplied to both sides of an equation, then both sides of the equation remain equal.
| The **division property of equality** states that if both sides of an equation are divided by the same number, then both sides of the equation remain equal.
| The **symmetric property of equality** states that an equation can be flipped
| The **transitive property of equality** states that sates that if two equations contain a common variable, they can be joined by the common variable.
| The **substitution property of equality** states that a value can be replaced by its alterative value 
| The **distributive property** states that a value being multiplied on a sum of difference can be multiplied to each individual number.  
| The **two-column proof** is a proof organized into two columns, statements and reasons.

.. rubric:: Example of Two-Column Proof

**Given equation to solve:**

.. math::

  \frac{5(x - 2) + 7}{12} = 7

To write this in two column format, you need to specify every step for finding *x* aa.

.. list-table:: 
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Statement
    - Reason
  
  * - :math:`\frac{5(x - 2) + 7}{12} = 7` 
    - Given
  
  * - :math:`5(x - 2) + 7 = 84` 
    - Multiplication Property of Equality
  
  * - :math:`5(x - 2) = 77` 
    - Subtraction Property of Equality
  
  * - :math:`5x - 10 = 77`
    - Distributive Property
  
  * - :math:`5x = 87`
    -  Addition Property of Equality
  
  * - :math:`x = 17.4`
    - Division Property of Equality
