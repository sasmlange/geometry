Chapter 2: Logical Arguments and Line Relationships 
==========================================================

2.1: Conjectures and Counterexamples
-----------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocablary

| A **conterexample** statement where the hypothesis is the same but conclusion is different.
| **Inductive reasoning** is reasoning with examples
| A **conjecture** is a concluding statement based on inductive reasoning 

.. rubric:: Example of Conterexample

| Hypothesis: The lost planet is round.
| Conclusion: The planet is Neptune as Neptune is round.
| Conterexample: Mars is also round.

Since a conterexample was provided, the conclusion is false.

.. rubric:: Example of Conjectures

Think about this pattern: *0, 5, 10, 15, 20*

A conclusion or conjecture can be made that it incresses by 5.


2.2: Statements, Conditionals, and Biconditionals
------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocablary

| A **truth value** is whether or not a statement is true based on the given information.
| A **truth table** is a table where truth values are organized.

.. rubric:: Logical Operators

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Name
      - Symbol
    * - `^`
      - And
    * - `v`
      - Or
    * - `~`
      - Not 
    
.. rubric:: Truth Tables

| a: Mars is red
| b: Mars is blue


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - a
     - b
     - a v b
     - a ^ b
     - ~b
   * - true
     - false
     - true
     - false
     - false


2.3: Deductive Reasoning
-----------------------------
.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **conditional statement** is written in a if then statement. 
| Switching the if and then makes it a **converse** of the statement. 
| An **inverse** of a statement is when you take the oposite of the if and the opposite of the then.
| A **contrapositive** is the inverse of the converse.

.. rubric:: Python Examples of Vocabulary

.. code-block:: python

  # fact
  a = True
  b = False

  # conditional statement
  if a:
    b = False

  # converse
  if not b:
    a = True

  # inverse
  if not a:
    b = not False # aka True
  
  # contrapositive
  if b:
    a = not True # aka False

All of these ifs produce the same result!!!

.. rubric:: Identifying the Hypothesis and Conclusion

The hypothesis is the statement that follows the if while the conclusion follows the then. 

**For example:**

.. code-block:: python

  if a:
    b = True

In this example :code:`a` or :code:`a == True` is the hypothesis and :code:`b = True` is the conclusion.
