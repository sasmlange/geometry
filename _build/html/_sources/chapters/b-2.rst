Chapter 2: Logical Arguments and Line Relationships 
==========================================================

2.1: Conjectures and Counterexamples
-----------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocablary

| A **conterexample** statement where the hypothesis is the same but conclusion is different.
| **Inductive reasoning** is reasoning with examples
| A **conjecture** is a concluding statement based on inductive reasoning 

.. rubric:: Example of Conterexample

| Hypothesis: The lost planet is round.
| Conclusion: The planet is Neptune as Neptune is round.
| Conterexample: Mars is also round.

Since a conterexample was provided, the conclusion is false.

.. rubric:: Example of Conjectures

Think about this pattern: *0, 5, 10, 15, 20*

A conclusion or conjecture can be made that it incresses by 5.


2.2: Statements, Conditionals, and Biconditionals
------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocablary

| A **truth value** is whether or not a statement is true based on the given information.
| A **truth table** is a table where truth values are organized.

.. rubric:: Logical Operators

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Name
      - Symbol
    * - `^`
      - And
    * - `v`
      - Or
    * - `~`
      - Not 
    
.. rubric:: Truth Tables

| a: Mars is red
| b: Mars is blue


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - a
     - b
     - a v b
     - a ^ b
     - ~b
   * - true
     - false
     - true
     - false
     - false
