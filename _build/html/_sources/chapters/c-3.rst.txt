Chapter 3: Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
====================================================

3.1: Parallel Lines and Transversal
--------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| **Parallel lines** never intersect.
| A **transversal** goes though two parallel lines.
| **Corresponding angles** are both on the same side of separate parallel lines and on the same side of the transversal.
| **Vertical angle** is when opposite angles formed when two lines intersect, always congruent.
| **Alternate exterior angles** are on the oposite side of separate parallel lines and on the oposite side of the transversal. They are always on the outside.
| **Alternate interior angles** are on the oposite side of separate parallel lines and on the oposite side of the transversal. They are always on the inside.
| **Same side interior angles** are on the inside angles of separate parallel lines and on the same side of the transversal.
| **Same side exterior angles** are on the outside angles of separate parallel lines and on the same side of the transversal.

:math:`\angle 1` and :math:`\angle 5` are corresponding angles. :math:`\angle 1` and :math:`\angle 4` are vertical angles. :math:`\angle 1` and :math:`\angle 8` are alternate exterior angles. :math:`\angle 4` and :math:`\angle 5` are alternate interior angles. The previous angles were congruent. The following are supplementary. :math:`\angle 3` and :math:`\angle 5` are same side interior angles. :math:`\angle 1` and :math:`\angle 7` are same side exterior angles.  

3.2: Angles and parallel lines
--------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| The **corresponding angle theorem** states that if a transversal goes though two parallel lines, then it it's corresponding angles are congruent. 
| The **converse corresponding angle theorem** states if 2 lines and a transversal form corresponding angles, then the lines are parallel.
| The **transitive property of congruence** states that a line segment that is congruent to another can be replaced by that segment.
| The **transitive property of equality** states that sates that if two equations contain a common variable, they can be joined by the common variable.

3.3: Slopes of lines
----------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| The **slope** of a line is the steepness of the line.
| **Parallel lines** are two lines that never meet and have the same slope. 
| **Perpendicular lines** intersect at :math:`90^{\circ}` angle and have oposite reciprocal slopes.
| The **oposite reciprocal** is when you multiply the reciprocal of a number by :math:`-1`.
 

.. note:: 

    Any number multiplied by it oposite reciprocal will result in :math:`-1` 

.. rubric:: Finding the Slope of a Perpendicular Line

Example: If :math:`y = \frac{1}{2} x - 123` then the perpendicular line slope would be :math:`-\frac{2}{1}` or :math:`-2`.


3.4: Equations of lines
-----------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| **Slope intercept form** is when a liner equation is written in :math:`y=mx+b`
| **Point slope form** is when a liner equation is written in :math:`y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)`

3.5: Proving lines parallel
------------------------------

3.6: Perpendiculars and Distance
----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Finding Distence Between Parallel Lines (long)

#. Find a perpendicular line to the parallel lines
#. Find the point the transversal intersects each parallel line using a system of equations
#. Find the distence beween the the points with the distance formula

.. rubric:: Finding Distence Between Parallel Lines (shortcut)

The shortcut is:

.. math::

    \frac{|c â€“ c1|}{sqrt(a^2 + b^2)}

When seen in :math:`ax + bx = c`

When seen in :math:`y = mx +b`:

.. math::

    d = \frac{|c_2 - c_1|}{\sqrt{1 + m^2}}



.. rubric:: Finding Distence Between a Line and a Point (long)

#. Find a perpendicular line to the parallel lines that passes though the point
#. Find the point the perpendicular line intersects the line using a system of equations
#. Find the distence beween the the points with the distance formula
