Chapter 5: Relationships in Triangles 
============================================

5.1: Bisectors of Triangles
--------------------------------
.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **bisector** splits an angle or segment into two congruent parts.
| The **angle bisector theorem** states that it is an equal distance from the angle bisector to each side of the angle is equal if the line is perpendicular to the side.
| The **perpendicular bisector** is the line that bisects a line and is perpendicular to that line.
| The **perpendicular bisectors theorem** states that if any point on the perpendicular bisector is the same distance from the two base endpoints.

.. rubric:: Angle Bisector Theorem

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/51-angle_bisector.drawio

If :math:`\overrightarrow{AC}` bisects :math:`\angle BAD`, then :math:`\overline{BC} \cong \overline{CD}`.

.. rubric:: Perpendicular Bisectors

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/51-perpendicular_bisector.drawio

:math:`\overleftrightarrow{AC}` is the perpendicular bisector as :math:`\overline{AD} \cong \overline{AB}`. Point A is equal to the distance from point B than to point D. Since :math:`m \angle ACB = 90^\circ`, point C is the midpoint of :math:`\overline{DB}`. 


5.2: Medians and Altitudes of Triangles
--------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **median** of a triangle is a line segment originating at a vertex and ending at the midpoint of the oposite side.
| An **altitude** of a triangle is a line segment originating at a vertex and perpendicular to the oposite side.
| A **angle bisector** of a triangle is a ray that bisects a vertex.
| A **perpendicular bisector** of a triangle is a line segment that forms a right angle on a side originating at the midpoint of that side.
| The **centroid** of a triangle is where all three medians meet, the center of mass.


.. rubric:: Example

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/52-vocabulary.drawio

:math:`\overline{BE}` is a median. :math:`\overline{DF}` is a altitude. :math:`\overrightarrow{AC}` is a angle bisector. :math:`overline{GC}` is a perpendicular bisector. 

.. rubric:: How to find The Centroid of a Triangle (long way)?

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/52-centroid_finding.drawio

1. Find the midpoint of a side

.. math:: 

    midpoint_{BC} &= ( \frac{7 - 5}{2}, \frac{-3 - 3}{2} ) \\
    midpoint_{BC} &= (1, -3) \\

2. Find the equation (use point slope)

.. math:: 

    y - 6 &= \frac{9}{2} (x - 3) \\
    y - 6 &= \frac{9}{2} x - \frac{27}{2} \\

3. Solve using systems of equations (:math:`( \frac{5}{3}, 0)` )

.. note:: 

    No need to find the third median as it would go though the same point.

.. rubric:: How to find The Centroid of a Triangle (short way)?

Find the average of all three x and y values.

.. math:: 

    centroid &= (\frac{3 - 5 + 7}{3}, \frac{6 - 3 - 3}{3}) \\
    centroid &= (\frac{5}{3}, 0) \\

Last Minute Notes :)
------------------------

| The **Centroid Theorem** states that the medians of a triangle intersect at a point that is two thirds of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. This point is called the centroid.
| The **Incenter Theorem** states that the angle bisectors of a triangle intersect at a point equidistant from the sides of the triangle.
The point is called the incenter.
| The **Circumcenter Theorem** states that the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle intersect at a single point.
This point is equidistant from the vertices of the triangle and is called the circumcenter.
