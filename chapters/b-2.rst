Chapter 2: Logical Arguments and Line Relationships 
==========================================================

2.1: Conjectures and Counterexamples
-----------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **conterexample** statement where the hypothesis is the same but conclusion is different.
| **Inductive reasoning** is reasoning with examples
| A **conjecture** is a concluding statement based on inductive reasoning 

.. rubric:: Example of Conterexample

| Hypothesis: The lost planet is round.
| Conclusion: The planet is Neptune as Neptune is round.
| Conterexample: Mars is also round.

Since a conterexample was provided, the conclusion is false.

.. rubric:: Example of Conjectures

Think about this pattern: *0, 5, 10, 15, 20*

A conclusion or conjecture can be made that it incresses by 5.


2.2: Statements, Conditionals, and Biconditionals
------------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **truth value** is whether or not a statement is true based on the given information.
| A **truth table** is a table where truth values are organized.

.. rubric:: Logical Operators

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Name
      - Symbol
    * - `^`
      - And
    * - `v`
      - Or
    * - `~`
      - Not 
    
.. rubric:: Truth Tables

| a: Mars is red
| b: Neptune is green


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - a
     - b
     - a v b
     - a ^ b
     - ~b
   * - true
     - false
     - true
     - false
     - false


2.3: conditional Statements
-----------------------------
.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **conditional statement** is written in a if then statement. 
| Switching the if and then makes it a **converse** of the statement. 
| An **inverse** of a statement is when you take the oposite of the if and the opposite of the then.
| A **contrapositive** is the inverse of the converse.

.. rubric:: Python Examples of Vocabulary

.. code-block:: python

  # fact
  a = True
  b = False

  # conditional statement
  if a:
    b = False

  # converse
  if not b:
    a = True

  # inverse
  if not a:
    b = not False # aka True
  
  # contrapositive
  if b:
    a = not True # aka False

All of these ifs produce the same result!!!

.. rubric:: Identifying the Hypothesis and Conclusion

The hypothesis is the statement that follows the if while the conclusion follows the then. 

**For example:**

.. code-block:: python

  if a:
    b = True

In this example :code:`a` or :code:`a == True` is the hypothesis and :code:`b = True` is the conclusion.



2.4: Deductive Reasoning
---------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| **Deductive reasoning** is when a logical conclusion is reached from using facts, rules, definitions, or properties.
| The **Law of Detachment** is a valid form of deductive reasoning with an if then format and a conclusion.
| The **Law of Syllogism** is a valid form of deductive reasoning which can be used to pice together two or more statements in which one has a conclusion of the other hypothesis.

.. rubric:: Examples

| **Given:** If you ride to school then you have a bike. Bob rides to school.
| **Conclusion:** Bob has a bike

This is a valid conclusion made using the Law of Detachment.

.. note::

  If the converse of the given hypothesis was given, then the conclusion would be invalid.  This is because the fact code :code:`Bob rides to school` would address the conclusion instead of the hypothesis.


2.5: Postulate and Paragraph Proof
---------------------------------------



.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| An **axiom** is a statement that is accepted without proof. 
| An **postual** is the same as an axiom. 
| A **paragraph proof** is a paragraph to explain why a conjecture is true. 

.. rubric:: Proofs

#. Though any two points, there is one line.
#. Though any three points, there is one plane.
#. A line contains at least two points
#. A plane contains as least three points
#. If two points of a line are in a plane, the line is on the line.

2.6: Algebraic Proof
-------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| The **property of equality** states that if the same operation is conducted on both sides of an equation on the same number, then both sides of an equations are equal.
| The **addition property of equality** states that if a number is added to both sides of an equation, then both sides of an equation are equal.
| The **subtraction property of equality** states that if a number is subtraction from both sides of an equation then both sides of an equation are equal.
| The **multiplication property of equality** states that if a number is multiplied to both sides of an equation, then both sides of the equation remain equal.
| The **division property of equality** states that if both sides of an equation are divided by the same number, then both sides of the equation remain equal.
| The **symmetric property of equality** states that an equation can be flipped
| The **transitive property of equality** states that sates that if two equations contain a common variable, they can be joined by the common variable.
| The **substitution property of equality** states that a value can be replaced by its alterative value 
| The **distributive property** states that a value being multiplied on a sum of difference can be multiplied to each individual number.  
| The **two-column proof** is a proof organized into two columns, statements and reasons.

.. rubric:: Example of Two-Column Proof

**Given:** :math:`frac{5(x - 2) + 7}{12} = 7` 

**Prove:** :math:`x = 17.4` 

To write this in two column format, you need to specify every step for finding *x* aa.

.. list-table:: 
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Statement
    - Reason
  
  * - :math:`\frac{5(x - 2) + 7}{12} = 7` 
    - Given
  
  * - :math:`5(x - 2) + 7 = 84` 
    - Multiplication Property of Equality
  
  * - :math:`5(x - 2) = 77` 
    - Subtraction Property of Equality
  
  * - :math:`5x - 10 = 77`
    - Distributive Property
  
  * - :math:`5x = 87`
    -  Addition Property of Equality
  
  * - :math:`x = 17.4`
    - Division Property of Equality
  



2.7: Proving Segment Relationships
-----------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| The **ruler postulate** states that a point on a line can be put into one to one comparison with real life numbers.
| The **segment addition postulate** states that if a point is in the middle of two points, then the length from one point to the point in the middle plus the other point equals the distance between the two points.
| The **reflexive property of congruence** states that a line segment is congruent to itself.
| The **symmetric property of congruence** states that it is possible can flip an equation.
| The **transitive property of congruence** states that if a equation has a common side, they can be joined.


2.8: Proving Angel Relationships
--------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| The **definition of congruent angles** states that perpendicular lines form a :math:`90^\circle` angle.
| The **definition of supplementary angles** states that supplementary angles form a :math:`180^\circle`
| The **definition of complementary angles** states that complementary angles form a :math:`90^\circle`
