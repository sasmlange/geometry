Chapter 1: Tools of Geometry 
===================================

1.1: Points, Lines, and Planes
-----------------------------------
.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **point** is a single point that is zero dimensional.
| A **line segment** extends from one point (endpoint) to another point.
| A **line** extends from infinitely in two directions and can be referred by a line segment (two points) on the line.
| A **ray** is a line that extends from one point (endpoint) to infinity in one directions
| A **plane** is flat surface (like a paper) that extends to infinity. It is often portrayed as a parallelogram. Can be referred to by three points on the plane.
| Two lines or planes that are **parallel** never meet or intersect
| Two lines or planes that are **perpendicular** meet or intersect at a :math:`90^{\circ}` angle. 

.. rubric:: Visual Planes, Points, Lines, and Rays

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/11-plane_line_ray_point.drawio

Line segment :math:`\overline{AB}` lies on line :math:`l` which can be referred to as line :math:`\overleftrightarrow{AB}`. line :math:`l` and line :math:`y` meet at point :math:`E`. Ray :math:`z` (or :math:`\overrightarrow{BE}`) originates at point :math:`B`. Everything is on plane :math:`x` (or plane :math:`FCD`). 

.. rubric:: Intersecting Planes

Two lines meet at a point while two planes meet at a line. 

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/11-2_planes_meeting.drawio

Plane :math:`FEH` meets plane :math:`ABC` at :math:`\overleftrightarrow{IJ}`.

.. note::

    Remember that planes, like lines, extend forever. Therefore planes meet at lines, not at line segments as it might appear from the visual. In this example, plane :math:`FEH` meets plane :math:`ABC` at :math:`\overleftrightarrow{IJ}`, not at :math:`\overline{IJ}`.



1.2: Line Segments and Distance
------------------------------------

.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **congruent** line segment is the same length as another line segment. More information below.


.. rubric:: Additive property of length

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/12-congruent_line_segments.drawio

According to the additive property of length, :math:`\overline{AB} + \overline{BC} = \overline{AC}` 

.. rubric:: Distance Formula

This is used to find the distance between two points on a coordinate plane. This formula is not actually a formula as it states to simply use the Pythagorean theorem to solve (:math:`rise^2 + run^2 = distance^2`). 

.. rubric:: Finding a Line Segment Length with Algebra

**Example Question: Find the value of x and RS if S is between R and T if :math:`RS = 5x, ST = 3x, RT = 48`**

We first find x:

.. math:: 

    \overline{RS} + \overline{ST} &= \overline{RT} \\
    5x + 3x &= 48 \\
    8x &= 48 \\
    x &= 6 \\

We can then find :math:`\overline{RS}` with :math:`x \cdot 5 = 30`.

.. rubric:: Congruent Line Segments

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/12-congruent_line_segments.drawio

In the image, :math:`\overline{AB}` is congruent with :math:`\overline{BC}` as they are both the same length. In fancy terms thats :math:`\overline{AB} \cong \overline{BC}`.


1.3: Locating Points and Midpoints
---------------------------------------
.. rubric:: Vocabulary

| A **midpoint** is a point in the middle of a line segment or coordinate plane.

.. rubric:: Finding the Midpoint

Formula for finding the midpoint on a line segment:

.. math:: 

    \frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}

.. tip::

    A bit like finding an average for a dataset

Formula for finding the midpoint on a line on a coordinate plane:

.. math:: 

    (\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2}, \frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2})

For example for the points (0, 0) and (12, 8):

.. math:: 
    midpoint &= (\frac{0 + 12}{2}, \frac{0 + 8}{2}) \\
    midpoint &= (6, 2)

(6, 2) is the coordinate for the midpoint.

.. rubric:: Distance Formula

This is used to find the distance between two points on a coordinate plane. This formula is not actually a formula as it states to simply use the Pythagorean theorem to solve (:math:`rise^2 + run^2 = distance^2`). 

    

1.4: Angle Measure
-----------------------

 .. rubric:: Vocabulary

| An **acute** angle is an angle that is less than :math:`90^{\circ}`
| An **obtuse** angle is an angle that is less than :math:`180^{\circ}` and greater than :math:`90^{\circ}`
| A **right** angle is an angle that is :math:`90^{\circ}`
| A **side** of an angle is the two rays that for the angle
| A **vertex** is a common endpoint of rays/sides
| **Congruent angles** are angles that has the same length 
| An **angle bisector** is a ray that spits an angle into two congruent angles.

.. note:: 

    You can refer to an angle by a point on both sides and the vertex

.. rubric:: Finding the vertex

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/14-vertex-finding.drawio

If we want to find the vertex for :math:`\angle 1`, we first check what sides make up :math:`\angle 1`. In this figure, :math:`\overrightarrow{AC}` and :math:`\overrightarrow{AB}` make up the angle. The common meeting point or vertex is at point :math:`A`.


.. rubric:: Solving x from Angle Bisector

.. drawio-image:: diagrams/bisect_angle_algebra.drawio
If :math:`m \angle ABE = 60` and  :math:`m \angle ABD = 4x + 14`, what is x?

Knowing that :math:`\angle ABD` bisects :math:`\angle ABE`:

.. math:: 

    2(4x + 14) &= 60  \\
    4x + 14 &= 30 \\
    4x &= 16 \\
    x &= 4
